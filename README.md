# react-native-sync-swiper

A modified version of react-native-swiper, so the swiper can be sync to each other

The code is based on [leecade/react-native-swiper](https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper), with different purpose.

The main difference is that, when there is multiple swiper inside an swiper, it will be able to track the index of each swiper and sync the position of them.
